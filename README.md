This smart contract is an implementation of an ERC-721 contract (a type of decentralized cryptocurrency contract based on Ethereum that allows for the creation of non-fungible tokens). It is called `LW3Punks` and allows users to "mine" (create) one NFT (non-fungible token) per transaction by sending the appropriate amount of Ether. The NFT tokens have a `specified base URI` specified in the constructor call that is used to calculate the URI for each token. The contract also has a `setPaused` function that allows for pausing or resuming the contract, and a `withdraw` function that allows the contract owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract to their address. It also has a `receive` function and a `fallback` function that allow the contract to receive Ether from other addresses.

<h2> Requirements </h2>

- There should only exist 10 LearnWeb3 Punk NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- The metadata for the NFT's should be stored on IPFS
- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.
- The NFT contract should be deployed on Mumbai testnet

You can see the smart contract on Polygonscan: <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xe4a6a7249730a9d19587c7ef67e87d11a95d193c">Project</a>.

üö® Note: Remember to put your polygonScan API in your `.env` file, as there is a script in `scripts/deploy.js` to instantly verify our smart contract after it is deployed.
